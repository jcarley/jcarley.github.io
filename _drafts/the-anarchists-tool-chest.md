## Chapter 5 - Essential Planes

### The five planes - page 59
  * A jack plane with a couple of extra irons
  * A plow plane
  * A rabbet plane
  * A block plane
  * A router plane

### The Jack of Your Trade

Bench planes are divided into three categories of tools
   1) The jack plane (fore plane).  General usage is for rough stock removal.  No. 5 or 6.
      Designed to remove material quickly.
   2) The try/jointer plane.  Used to make accurate sufaces.  No. 7 or 8.
      Makes surfaces a flat as possible.  Tried and true be a edge or face.
   3) The smoothing plane.  Make surface ready for finish.  No. 1 to 4 1/2.
      Produces a surface that is ready for finish.

Don't need every type of bench plane.  At the least you can get by with a jack
plane a few other irons.

### Four Kinds of Bodies - page 63

####  Metal-bodied Bench Planes
Entirely metal except for front knob and the tote.

  Advantages:

    * Old planes can be restored
    * Parts are available everywhere
    * Work better with taller benches
    * The metallic body keeps the plane in the cut
    * Adjustable mouth

  Disadvantages:

    * Heavier
    * Truing makes a mess of iron and steel filings
    * Takes a lot of time to true up
    * Lots of moving parts
    * Can rust
    * Break or chip if dropped

#### About the Bevel-up Metallic Planes - page 64

Bench planes can have bevel-up or bevel-down irons.

Bevel-up planes are simplier to achieve high planning angles.

Cuttin principles of the two types are exactly the same.

#### Wooden-bodied Planes - page 65

Body of a wooden plane is called the stock. (Wooden-stock planes)

  Advantages:

    * Have fewer parts than metallic planes.  Makes diagnosing problems more
      straightforward.
    * Taller, so work better on shorter benches.
    * Can true a sole quickly because the body is generally made of beech.
    * Lighter weight.  Less fatique

  Disadvantages:

    * Wooden planes suffer from the same problems as any other wooden object,
      wood moves.  High maintenance.
    * Can be difficult for beginners to diagnose problems.
